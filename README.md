# MQTT-GW-housing
3D-printed housing for an MySensors MQTT-gateway

I recently designed a housing for my MQTT-Gateway, based on an ESP8266 module (Node-MCU) and an nRF24L01+PA+LNA. 
The housing printed great using PLA on my FF Creator Pro. 
Connections are made using Dupont cables cut in half and soldered directly to the nRF24 where the pins have been removed.
